    "**Pseudonymization** by substituting a false identifier for true identifiers is sometimes useful.  Unfortunately, it is often the case that it is both acceptable and needed to be able to re-identify data after the anonymized form has been processed.  The common technique to enable re-identification is to maintain a separate mapping of the pseudonymous identifier to the true identifier (i.e., a cross reference table).  This table is kept separately from the anonymized data, but since this table contains the mapping back to the \"identified\" world, it must be carefully protected from theft.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Shuffling** column values is often fairly easy to unravel.  Shuffling rows (records) in a table or a file is sometimes a good idea.  For example, a data provider may know the order of the records (i.e., which record belongs with which person) in a file without including any PII fields or columns.  If we process that file, adding attributes, then return the file to the provider, the provider can easily re-identify the individuals associated with the data.   Randomizing the row/record order (e.g., sorting on an added random field) before returning the file to the provider can prevent this re-identification. "

It is possible for hashing algorithms to have *collisions* where two distinct input values to produce the same hashed output value.
